Here's a sample `README.md` file for your **Online Banking System** project, including details about the structure, SQL database, and how to run the project.

# Online Banking System

This is an **Online Banking System** built using Java (JSP), Maven, and MySQL. The project allows users to log in, sign up, and manage their bank accounts.

## Features

- **Login & Signup**: Allows users to sign up and log in to the banking system.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage user accounts and banking transactions.
- **User Dashboard**: Users can view their account balance, transaction history, and more.

---

## Project Structure

### 1. **Database (MySQL)**

### SQL Schema for the Database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE BankingSystem;

USE BankingSystem;

CREATE TABLE Admin (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

- **`Admin` Table**: Stores admin details like name, email, and password.

### 2. **File Structure**

```
/OnlineBankingSystem
│
├── /src
│   ├── /controller
│   │   ├── LoginServlet.java
│   │   ├── SignupServlet.java
│   │
│   ├── /dao
│   │   ├── AdminDao.java
│   │
│   ├── /model
│   │   ├── Admin.java
│
├── /webapp
│   ├── login.jsp
│   ├── signup.jsp
│
└── pom.xml
```

- **`/controller`**: Contains servlets for handling user login and signup.
- **`/dao`**: Contains the Data Access Object (DAO) for interacting with the database.
- **`/model`**: Contains Java classes representing the system's entities (e.g., Admin).
- **`/webapp`**: Contains JSP files for the login and signup pages.

## How to Set Up

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OnlineBanking.git
```

### 2. **Set Up MySQL Database**

1. **Create the Database**: Open MySQL and execute the SQL commands to create the `BankingSystem` database and `Admin` table:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE BankingSystem;

   USE BankingSystem;

   CREATE TABLE Admin (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. **Configure the Database Connection**:
   Ensure that your project is connected to the correct MySQL database in the `web.xml` or in the `DAO` class using the appropriate JDBC connection string.

---

### 3. **Run the Project**

1. **Install Maven**: If Maven is not installed, download and install it from [here](https://maven.apache.org/).
2. **Build the Project**:
   In your project root directory, run the following command to build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. **Deploy the Project**:
   - If you are using **Apache Tomcat**, deploy the WAR file generated by Maven under the `/target` folder to the Tomcat `webapps` directory.
   - Alternatively, you can run the project using any IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

---

### 4. **Access the Application**

Once the server is running, you can access the login page at:
```
http://localhost:8080/OnlineBankingSystem/login.jsp
```

---

## File Descriptions

### **`login.jsp`**
The `login.jsp` page allows users to enter their credentials to log in to their accounts.

### **`signup.jsp`**
The `signup.jsp` page enables new users to create an account by providing their name, email, and password.

### **`LoginServlet.java`**
Handles the logic for user login, including checking credentials and redirecting to the user dashboard if successful.

### **`SignupServlet.java`**
Handles user signup, including storing new user details in the database.

### **`AdminDao.java`**
The DAO class contains methods for interacting with the `Admin` table in the database.

### **`Admin.java`**
The model class represents an Admin entity, with properties such as `id`, `name`, `email`, and `password`.

---

## Database Configuration

In the project, the database connection string and credentials will typically be stored in a configuration file or within the `DAO` class. Modify the connection settings based on your environment (e.g., MySQL user, password, database name).

Example of a simple JDBC connection in `AdminDao.java`:

```java
public class AdminDao {
    private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/BankingSystem";
    private static final String DB_USER = "root";
    private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "password";

    public Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        return DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD);
    }
}
```
